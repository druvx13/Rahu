            <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
            <p>Now, we shall explain the Mahopanishad. It is said: In the beginning, there was only Narayana.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>There was no Brahma, no Ishana, no waters, no fire and moon, no heaven and earth,</p>
                <p>No stars, no sun, no moon. He, being alone, did not enjoy. From his meditation, the sacrifice was born.</p>
                <p>From that, fourteen Purushas were born: one maiden, ten senses, the mind as the eleventh,</p>
                <p>Tejas as the twelfth, ego as the thirteenth, breath as the fourteenth, the self as the fifteenth,</p>
                <p>And intellect as the sixteenth. The five elements, five subtle elements, and five gross elements.</p>
                <p>Thus, the one becomes the twenty-five Purushas. Having placed the Purusha, the years are born.</p>
                <p>From the years, others are born. Then again, Narayana desired another through meditation.</p>
                <p>From his meditation, from his forehead, a three-eyed, trident-holding Purusha was born,</p>
                <p>Bearing prosperity, fame, truth, celibacy, austerity, detachment, mind, sovereignty,</p>
                <p>With the Pranava, Vyāhṛtis, Rig, Yajur, Sama, Atharva Vedas, all meters resting in his limbs.</p>
                <p>Therefore, he is Ishana, the great god, Mahadeva. Then again, Narayana desired another through meditation.</p>
                <p>From his meditation, sweat fell from his forehead. These became the spread-out waters.</p>
                <p>Then, a golden orb of light appeared. In it, the four-faced Brahma was born. He meditated:</p>
                <p>Facing east, "Bhūḥ" as the Vyāhṛti, Gāyatrī meter, Rig Veda, Agni as the deity.</p>
                <p>Facing west, "Bhuvaḥ" as the Vyāhṛti, Triṣṭubh meter, Yajur Veda, Vāyu as the deity.</p>
                <p>Facing north, "Svaḥ" as the Vyāhṛti, Jagatī meter, Sama Veda, Surya as the deity.</p>
                <p>Facing south, "Mahaḥ" as the Vyāhṛti, Anuṣṭubh meter, Atharva Veda, Soma as the deity.</p>
                <p>The god with a thousand heads, a thousand eyes, the source of the universe,</p>
                <p>The eternal supreme beyond the universe, the universe is Narayana, Hari.</p>
                <p>This universe is indeed the Purusha, and the universe lives on him.</p>
                <p>The lord of the universe, the god in the ocean, having the form of the universe,</p>
                <p>Like a lotus bud, resembling a hanging sheath, with the heart facing downward,</p>
                <p>For the sake of continuity, with hissing sounds. In its midst is a great flame,</p>
                <p>Universal flame, facing all directions. In the middle of that is the flame of fire,</p>
                <p>Smaller than the smallest, standing upward. In the middle of that flame, the supreme self is established.</p>
                <p>He is Brahma, he is Ishana, he is Indra, he is the imperishable, the supreme ruler. Thus is the Mahopanishad.</p>

            <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
            <p>There was a sage named Shuka, of great splendor, devoted to the bliss of his own nature.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>From birth, he, the king of sages, attained the truth.</p>
                <p>Through his own discrimination, this great-minded one,</p>
                <p>After long and proper reflection, attained certainty about the self.</p>
                <p>Because it is nameless and unreachable, situated beyond the mind and the six senses,</p>
                <p>It is pure consciousness, the atomic self, subtler than space.</p>
                <p>Within the supreme conscious atom, the dust particles of billions of universes</p>
                <p>Undergo creation and sustenance and dissolve through the cycle of power.</p>
                <p>Space is external emptiness, but due to consciousness, it is not space.</p>
                <p>There is nothing that is indescribable, yet it is called existence.</p>
                <p>It is conscious because it is luminous, and due to the absence of knowables, it is like a stone.</p>
                <p>In its own self, in the space, it creates the wonderful manifestation of the world.</p>
                <p>This universe is merely its light; it cannot be separate from it.</p>
                <p>Even the diversity of the world is its light; thus, diversity is also made of it.</p>
                <p>It is all-pervading, related to all, yet due to the absence of movement, it does not go.</p>
                <p>It does not exist due to the absence of support, yet it exists due to its nature of existence.</p>
                <p>It is the bliss of knowledge, Brahman, the refuge of the giver and the receiver.</p>
                <p>The renunciation of all resolves and the acceptance by the mind.</p>
                <p>The wise call it the absence of perception in the waking state, yet it is perception.</p>
                <p>By its contraction and expansion, the dissolution and creation of the world occur.</p>
                <p>It is the culmination of Vedanta statements, beyond the reach of words.</p>
                <p>I am indeed the Brahman of existence, consciousness, and supreme bliss, not anything else.</p>
                <p>Through his own subtle intellect, Shuka knew everything.</p>
                <p>Having attained the supreme reality, his mind rested without agitation.</p>
                <p>He did not trust in the reality of this world in relation to the self.</p>
                <p>His mind simply ceased its restlessness towards objects,</p>
                <p>Like a bird turning away from abundant, breaking streams.</p>
                <p>Once, this pure-minded one, seated alone on Mount Meru,</p>
                <p>Asked his father, the sage Krishna Dvaipayana (Vyasa), with devotion:</p>
                <p>"O sage, how did this spectacle of the world arise?</p>
                <p>How does it attain peace? What, whose, when—tell me."</p>
                <p>Thus asked, the sage Vyasa told his son everything properly,</p>
                <p>As it should be spoken by one who knows the self.</p>
                <p>"I did not know this before," said Shuka, but his father replied,</p>
                <p>With his own intellect, Shuka did not regard the words highly.</p>
                <p>Vyasa, the blessed one, understanding his son’s intention,</p>
                <p>Said again to his son, "I do not know it truly.</p>
                <p>There is a king named Janaka in the city of Mithila.</p>
                <p>He knows what is to be known properly; from him, you will attain everything."</p>
                <p>Thus told by his father, Shuka went from Mount Meru to the earth,</p>
                <p>To the city of Videha, ruled by Janaka.</p>
                <p>He was announced to the great-souled Janaka by the gatekeepers:</p>
                <p>"O king, here stands Shuka, the son of Vyasa, at the gate."</p>
                <p>To test Shuka, Janaka said with indifference, "Let him be,"</p>
                <p>And remained silent for seven days.</p>
                <p>Then, Janaka had Shuka brought into the courtyard.</p>
                <p>There, he stayed for seven days, undisturbed.</p>
                <p>Then, Janaka brought him into the inner court.</p>
                <p>"The king is not to be seen," and thus he stayed for seven days.</p>
                <p>There, with intoxicated beautiful women, food, and heaps of pleasures,</p>
                <p>Janaka pampered Shuka, whose face was like the moon.</p>
                <p>But those pleasures and foods did not attract the mind of Vyasa’s son,</p>
                <p>Like a gentle breeze does not move a firmly fixed mountain.</p>
                <p>Only serene, pure, silent, with a joyful mind,</p>
                <p>Like the full moon, the spotless Shuka stood.</p>
                <p>Having recognized his nature, King Janaka brought him,</p>
                <p>And seeing him with a joyful self, bowed to him.</p>
                <p>Having accomplished all duties in the world, having attained all desires,</p>
                <p>He said, "What do you desire?" after welcoming him.</p>
                <p>"How did this spectacle of the world arise, O guru?</p>
                <p>How does it attain peace? Tell me properly and quickly."</p>
                <p>Everything was properly told by the great-souled Janaka,</p>
                <p>Just as it was previously told by his father, the great-minded one.</p>
                <p>"I myself had already known this specially.</p>
                <p>Indeed, this was told by my father when asked."</p>
                <p>"This very meaning has been told by you, O best of speakers.</p>
                <p>This very meaning is seen in the scriptures."</p>
                <p>"It is born from the mind’s imaginations, and with the destruction of imaginations,</p>
                <p>It perishes; the burnt world is essenceless, it is certain."</p>
                <p>"Then what is this, O great one? Tell me the truth, the immovable.</p>
                <p>From you, I attain rest with my mind wandering in the world."</p>
                <p>"Listen now to what is being said by me,</p>
                <p>O Shuka, the expansion of knowledge, the essence of intellect within.</p>
                <p>Through whose knowledge, a person immediately attains the state of living liberation.</p>
                <p>The cleansing of the mind from the seen, with the understanding that the seen does not exist,</p>
                <p>When accomplished, then the supreme peace of nirvana arises.</p>
                <p>The complete abandonment of desires is called liberation by the good;</p>
                <p>That alone is the pure path.</p>
                <p>Those with pure desires do not again become partakers of birth and misfortune.</p>
                <p>They are called knowers of what is to be known, the living liberated ones with great intellect.</p>
                <p>The firmness in the contemplation of objects is called bondage.</p>
                <p>The attenuation of desires, O Brahman, is called liberation.</p>
                <p>For whom, without any cause like austerity,</p>
                <p>Pleasures here do not appeal, he is called the living liberated.</p>
                <p>In the face of pleasures and pains that come in due time,</p>
                <p>He who neither rejoices nor grieves is called the living liberated.</p>
                <p>He who is not touched within by joy, anger, fear, wrath, desire, or miserliness,</p>
                <p>Is called the living liberated.</p>
                <p>He who, having abandoned the desire born of ego,</p>
                <p>Stays playfully, abandoning the object of meditation, is called the living liberated.</p>
                <p>He who has no praise or blame for desired or undesired things in his inner vision,</p>
                <p>And moves like one in deep sleep, is called the living liberated.</p>
                <p>Seated in spiritual delight, complete, with a pure mind,</p>
                <p>Having attained the supreme rest, he desires nothing here.</p>
                <p>He who lives without attachment is called the living liberated.</p>
                <p>He whose consciousness is not tainted even a little by the knowable in the space of the heart,</p>
                <p>That non-inert consciousness is called the living liberated.</p>
                <p>He who performs actions without regard for attachment, aversion, happiness, sorrow, virtue, vice, fruit, or non-fruit,</p>
                <p>Is called the living liberated.</p>
                <p>He who is silent, without ego, without pride, free from envy,</p>
                <p>Who acts without agitation, is called the living liberated.</p>
                <p>He who, without attachment everywhere, stays like a witness,</p>
                <p>Desireless in actions, is called the living liberated.</p>
                <p>He who has completely abandoned within virtue, vice, mind, and desires,</p>
                <p>Is called the living liberated.</p>
                <p>He who has completely abandoned the entire imagination of the seen that is perceived,</p>
                <p>Is called the living liberated.</p>
                <p>He who eats pungent, sour, salty, bitter, uncooked, and cooked food equally,</p>
                <p>Is called the living liberated.</p>
                <p>He who enjoys old age, death, adversity, kingdom, and poverty as delightful,</p>
                <p>Is called the living liberated.</p>
                <p>He who has completely abandoned with intellect virtue, vice, happiness, sorrow, death, and birth,</p>
                <p>Is called the living liberated.</p>
                <p>He who, free from agitation and joy, with a pure intellect,</p>
                <p>Neither grieves nor rejoices, is called the living liberated.</p>
                <p>He who has abandoned with intellect all desires, all doubts, all efforts, all certainties,</p>
                <p>Is called the living liberated.</p>
                <p>He whose mind is equal in birth, existence, destruction, rising, and setting,</p>
                <p>Is called the living liberated.</p>
                <p>He who hates nothing and desires nothing,</p>
                <p>Who enjoys natural pleasures, is called the living liberated.</p>
                <p>He who, though having parts, is without parts, though having a mind, is without a mind,</p>
                <p>With the calculations of the world calmed, is called the living liberated.</p>
                <p>He who, though engaged in all affairs, is desireless,</p>
                <p>Like one who is complete in others’ affairs, is called the living liberated.</p>
                <p>Having abandoned the state of living liberation, when the body is claimed by time,</p>
                <p>He enters the state of disembodied liberation, like the wind becoming still.</p>
                <p>The disembodied liberated one neither rises nor sets, neither calms down,</p>
                <p>Neither is nor is not, neither near nor far, neither I nor another.</p>
                <p>Then, something remains, still, profound, neither light nor darkness spread out,</p>
                <p>Unnamed, unmanifested, existing.</p>
                <p>Neither void nor form, neither seen nor seeing,</p>
                <p>Nor the multitude of elemental objects existing infinitely.</p>
                <p>Something indescribable, fuller than the full,</p>
                <p>Neither being nor non-being, neither existence nor non-existence, neither emotion nor imagination.</p>
                <p>Pure consciousness without objects, infinite, ageless, auspicious,</p>
                <p>Without beginning, middle, or end, beginningless, free from disease.</p>
                <p>That which is remembered as the vision in the midst of the seer, seeing, and seen,</p>
                <p>There is no higher certainty than this, O sage.</p>
                <p>You yourself have known it, and again heard it from the guru.</p>
                <p>Bound by one’s own resolve, one is liberated by the absence of resolve.</p>
                <p>Thus, you yourself have known what is to be known by the great-souled one,</p>
                <p>From whom aversion to pleasures or the entire seen has arisen.</p>
                <p>You have attained all that is to be attained with a complete mind.</p>
                <p>In your own nature, in austerity, O Brahman, you are liberated; abandon delusion.</p>
                <p>Seeing the extremely external, the external, the internal, and the innermost of the intellect,</p>
                <p>O Shuka, though seeing, you do not see; you are the witness, complete and alone.</p>
                <p>Shuka rested in silence, established in the supreme reality,</p>
                <p>Free from sorrow, fear, and effort, desireless, with doubts cut off.</p>
                <p>He went to the peak of Mount Meru for uninterrupted meditation.</p>
                <p>There, for thousands of years, in unwavering meditation,</p>
                <p>He stayed in that place and became calm, like a lamp without oil in himself.</p>
                <p>With all imaginations and impurities gone, pure,</p>
                <p>He, the great soul, in his own spotless self, in the sacred state,</p>
                <p>Like a drop of water in the ocean, attained oneness, with desires dissolved.</p>

            <p>Thus is the Mahopanishad.</p>

            <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
            <p>There was a sage named Nidagha, who had attained knowledge as a child.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>He traveled to sacred places with his father’s permission.</p>
                <p>Having bathed in three and a half crore sacred places, he returned home.</p>
                <p>The highly renowned one bowed to Ribhu and told his story.</p>
                <p>"From the merit of bathing in three and a half crore sacred places,</p>
                <p>A thought has arisen in my mind, and it is like this:</p>
                <p>The world is born and dies, and dies for rebirth.</p>
                <p>All these, with their actions, moving and unmoving, are unstable.</p>
                <p>They are the abode of all calamities, sinful states, and places of wealth.</p>
                <p>Like iron rods, they are mutually unattached.</p>
                <p>Only states dry up through this imagination of the mind.</p>
                <p>Attachment to states has come like a traveler in deserts.</p>
                <p>How does this suffering calm down? I am tormented in mind.</p>
                <p>The cycles of thoughts do not bring me joy; wealth does not.</p>
                <p>Houses with offspring are like fierce calamities.</p>
                <p>This delicate prosperity in the world is for delusion, O sage; it surely does not give happiness.</p>
                <p>Life is fragile like a drop of water hanging on the tip of a leaf.</p>
                <p>Like a madman, abandoning the body in the southern direction.</p>
                <p>For those whose minds are decayed by attachment to poisonous objects,</p>
                <p>Whose self-discrimination is not mature, life is a cause of toil.</p>
                <p>It is fitting to wrap the wind, to break space,</p>
                <p>To knot waves, but attachment to life is not fitting.</p>
                <p>That by which the attainable is attained, by which one does not grieve again,</p>
                <p>That is called life, the place of supreme peace.</p>
                <p>Even trees live, animals and birds live.</p>
                <p>He lives whose mind lives by contemplation.</p>
                <p>Only those beings in the world live well</p>
                <p>Who are not born again here; the rest are old donkeys.</p>
                <p>Scriptures are a burden for the discriminating, knowledge is a burden for the attached.</p>
                <p>The mind is a burden for the unpeaceful, the body is a burden for one who does not know the self.</p>
                <p>From ego come calamities, from ego come difficulties.</p>
                <p>From ego come desires; there is no enemy greater than ego.</p>
                <p>Whatever I have enjoyed, moving and unmoving, due to ego,</p>
                <p>All that is unreal; the reality is the emptiness of ego.</p>
                <p>Here and there, very anxiously, it runs in vain.</p>
                <p>The mind goes far, like a dog in a village.</p>
                <p>Led to inertness by the cruel one, following the wife of desire,</p>
                <p>Controlled like by a dog, O Brahman, I am liberated in mind.</p>
                <p>Even from drinking the ocean, from uprooting Mount Sumeru,</p>
                <p>From eating fire, O Brahman, the control of the mind is difficult.</p>
                <p>The mind is the cause of objects; when it exists, the three worlds exist.</p>
                <p>When it is destroyed, the world is destroyed; it should be treated with effort.</p>
                <p>Whichever excellence of qualities I resort to, O best of sages,</p>
                <p>Desire cuts it off like a mouse cuts a string.</p>
                <p>It makes a step even in the impassable, satisfied, it strives in vain.</p>
                <p>Desire, like a restless monkey, does not stay in one place for long.</p>
                <p>In a moment, it goes to the netherworld, in a moment to the sky,</p>
                <p>In a moment, it wanders in the groves of directions, desire, the six-footed one in the heart-lotus.</p>
                <p>Among all the sorrows of the world, desire alone gives long sorrow,</p>
                <p>Which, even staying in the inner chambers, places one in great difficulty.</p>
                <p>The mantra for the cholera of desire is the abandonment of thought, O twice-born.</p>
                <p>By a little, it brings joy; by a little, it brings sorrow.</p>
                <p>There is no one as pitiable as the body, lowly, devoid of qualities.</p>
                <p>The body is the great house of the householder ego.</p>
                <p>Whether it rolls or stays firm, what is it to me, O guru?</p>
                <p>The body-house, with senses bound in a row, desire prancing in the courtyard,</p>
                <p>Filled with mind-servants, is not desired by me.</p>
                <p>With the tongue-monkey occupying the mouth-door, terrifying,</p>
                <p>With seen fragments of teeth and bones, the body-house is not desired by me.</p>
                <p>Of this body made of blood and flesh, both inside and outside, O sage,</p>
                <p>Whose only nature is destruction, tell me, what is the beauty of the body?</p>
                <p>He who has determined stability in lightning, autumn clouds, and Gandharva cities,</p>
                <p>Let him trust in the body.</p>
                <p>In childhood, there is fear from the teacher, from the mother, from the father,</p>
                <p>From people, from elders and children; childhood is a house of fear.</p>
                <p>By the demon of desire dwelling in the cave of one’s own mind, causing various delusions,</p>
                <p>One is forcibly overpowered and helpless.</p>
                <p>Servants, sons, women, relatives, and friends</p>
                <p>Laugh at the man trembling with old age like a madman.</p>
                <p>In old age, the long desire full of wretchedness increases,</p>
                <p>The sole friend of all calamities, causing burning in the heart.</p>
                <p>Wherever this notion of happiness exists in the world,</p>
                <p>Time, having obtained it like a pillar, cuts it off.</p>
                <p>Grass, dust, Indra, gold, Mount Meru, mustard seed—</p>
                <p>With self-conceit, all are ready to be made one’s own.</p>
                <p>This time, the destroyer of all, has conquered the three worlds.</p>
                <p>Of the woman, a puppet of flesh, with a cage of limbs moving like a machine,</p>
                <p>Full of sinews, bones, and knots, what is beautiful?</p>
                <p>Having separated the skin, flesh, blood, tears, and water in the eyes,</p>
                <p>Look at it; if it is beautiful, why are you deluded in vain?</p>
                <p>Like the play of the Ganges on the slopes of Mount Meru’s peak,</p>
                <p>Seen in which, O sage, the playfulness of a pearl necklace.</p>
                <p>In cremation grounds, at the ends of directions, that same breast of a woman</p>
                <p>Is tasted by dogs in time, like a small lump of food.</p>
                <p>Women, with hair like collyrium, hard to touch, pleasing to the eyes,</p>
                <p>Are flames of the fire of sin, burning men like straw.</p>
                <p>Even burning from afar, even if juicy, they are dry.</p>
                <p>Women are indeed the fuel for the fires of hell, beautiful yet terrible.</p>
                <p>Scattered by the hunter named desire, the bewildered-minded</p>
                <p>Women are the snares for the birds of men, binding their limbs.</p>
                <p>For men, fish in the pond of birth, moving in the mud of mind,</p>
                <p>Woman is the bait on the hook of evil desires.</p>
                <p>With this excellent box of all jewels of faults,</p>
                <p>With the chain of sorrow, forever enough for me with woman.</p>
                <p>He who has a woman has desire for enjoyment; where is the place of enjoyment for one without a woman?</p>
                <p>Having abandoned woman, the world is abandoned; having abandoned the world, one becomes happy.</p>
                <p>Even directions are not seen, nor is another country a teacher.</p>
                <p>Even mountains crumble, even stars decay.</p>
                <p>Even oceans dry up, even the pole star has an unstable life.</p>
                <p>Even the perfected perish, even the demons age.</p>
                <p>Even the supreme lord has an end, even Hari, the unborn, declines.</p>
                <p>Even existence becomes non-existence, even the lords of directions age.</p>
                <p>Brahma, Vishnu, Rudra, and all beings</p>
                <p>Pursue destruction like waters to the ocean.</p>
                <p>Calamities come for a moment, prosperity comes for a moment,</p>
                <p>Birth for a moment, then death; all is indeed perishable.</p>
                <p>Heroes are killed by the unheroic, a hundred are killed by one.</p>
                <p>Poison is the inequality of objects; poison is not called poison.</p>
                <p>Objects destroy across births; poison destroys one birth.</p>
                <p>Thus, in my mind, burnt by the forest fire of faults,</p>
                <p>Desires for enjoyment do not shine even in the mirage lake.</p>
                <p>Therefore, enlighten me quickly with the knowledge of truth, O guru.</p>
                <p>Otherwise, adopting silence, without pride, free from envy,</p>
                <p>Contemplating Vishnu with the mind, like one dedicated to writing."</p>

            <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"Nidagha, there is nothing else for you to know, O best among the knowers.</p>
                <p>With your blessed intellect, you know through grace.</p>
                <p>I shall wipe away the confusion born of the impurity of the mind, O sage.</p>
                <p>At the door of liberation, four gatekeepers are proclaimed:</p>
                <p>Calmness, inquiry, contentment, and the fourth, association with the good.</p>
                <p>One should resort to one or all with all effort, abandoning everything.</p>
                <p>When one is controlled, all four come under control.</p>
                <p>First, for liberation from the world, one should develop wisdom</p>
                <p>Through scriptures, contact with good people, austerity, and self-control.</p>
                <p>When there is agreement between one’s experience, the scriptures, and the guru,</p>
                <p>Through practice, the self is always seen.</p>
                <p>If you abandon every moment the pursuit of resolves and desires,</p>
                <p>Then you have certainly attained the state of mindlessness, O pure one.</p>
                <p>The non-doership of the mind is called concentration.</p>
                <p>That alone is the state of aloneness, the supreme peace with auspiciousness.</p>
                <p>Having completely abandoned all thoughts of self and others with the mind,</p>
                <p>Stay as you are, like a mute, deaf, and blind person.</p>
                <p>All is calm, unborn, one, without beginning or middle,</p>
                <p>Luminous, self-knowing, without signs of objects.</p>
                <p>'All is calm' is a view made of words,</p>
                <p>Merely for the sake of refutation; thus, 'Om' is said.</p>
                <p>Being always awake in mind, even while performing worldly actions,</p>
                <p>Having known the oneness of the self, stay like an undisturbed great ocean.</p>
                <p>The understanding of truth alone is the fire for the grass of desires,</p>
                <p>Called concentration, not mere silent sitting.</p>
                <p>Just as people act in the presence of a desireless gem,</p>
                <p>So does this multitude of the world in the mere presence of the supreme truth.</p>
                <p>Therefore, O sage, in the self, there is both doership and non-doership.</p>
                <p>Due to desirelessness, it is a non-doer; due to mere presence, it is a doer.</p>
                <p>Know these two in Brahman, O sage, doership and non-doership.</p>
                <p>Wherever this wonder is, relying on that, be steady.</p>
                <p>Therefore, with the thought 'I am always a non-doer,' meditate with intellect.</p>
                <p>That supreme nectar-named equanimity alone remains.</p>
                <p>Nidagha, listen: those established in goodness, born on earth with great virtues,</p>
                <p>Are always exalted, joyful like the moon in themselves.</p>
                <p>They do not come to grief in calamity, like a golden lotus at night.</p>
                <p>They do not deviate from nature, they delight in the path of the good.</p>
                <p>They shine with their form, with virtues like friendliness,</p>
                <p>Equal, with equal taste, always with good conduct.</p>
                <p>Like the ocean, they have deep limits, with clear intentions.</p>
                <p>They do not abandon regularity, like the sun, the great ones.</p>
                <p>'Who am I? How is this?'—this dirt of the world spread out,</p>
                <p>Should be carefully examined by the wise with the good.</p>
                <p>One should not be engaged in actions, nor dwell with the ignoble.</p>
                <p>The destroyer of all, death, should not be disregarded.</p>
                <p>Having abandoned the body made of bones and flesh, unattractive with blood, etc.,</p>
                <p>One should see the self as pure consciousness, the thread of liberated elements.</p>
                <p>The rejection of the acceptable, the abandonment of the rejectable alone,</p>
                <p>That is the form of the mind; know it as external, not otherwise.</p>
                <p>Through the path taught by the guru and scriptures, and through one’s experience,</p>
                <p>In the dense consciousness, knowing 'I am Brahman,' one becomes a sage free from sorrow.</p>
                <p>Where the falling of a sharp sword is endured like striking a lotus,</p>
                <p>Burning by fire like sprinkling with snow,</p>
                <p>Rolling on embers like applying sandalwood,</p>
                <p>The falling of endless arrows like the shower of a summer house,</p>
                <p>Cutting off one’s head like pleasant sleep,</p>
                <p>Becoming mute like sealing the mouth,</p>
                <p>Deafness like a great gain—thus, without disregard,</p>
                <p>From firm detachment, knowledge arises.</p>
                <p>Through the words of the guru and the purity of one’s experience,</p>
                <p>By whose practice the self is always seen.</p>
                <p>Just as for one whose confusion about directions is destroyed, directions appear as before,</p>
                <p>So, with knowledge, the destroyed world does not exist—thus contemplate.</p>
                <p>Neither wealth, nor friends, nor relatives help,</p>
                <p>Nor the affliction of the body, nor resorting to sacred places.</p>
                <p>Only that, which is merely the mind, attains the state.</p>
                <p>The sorrows and desires that are unbearable, the difficulties,</p>
                <p>In those with peaceful minds, all that vanishes like darkness in the sun.</p>
                <p>Like a mother, both harsh and gentle things</p>
                <p>Gain trust in the world in one with calmness.</p>
                <p>Not through drinking elixirs, nor through embracing wealth,</p>
                <p>Does one attain such happiness as through inner peace.</p>
                <p>Having heard, touched, eaten, seen, known good and evil,</p>
                <p>He who neither rejoices nor grieves is called peaceful.</p>
                <p>He whose mind is clear like the moon in snow, undisturbed,</p>
                <p>In death, festivals, and battles, is called peaceful.</p>
                <p>Among ascetics, the learned, sacrificers, kings,</p>
                <p>The strong, the virtuous, the one with peace shines.</p>
                <p>Those who are peaceful, having drunk the nectar of contentment,</p>
                <p>Are satisfied; the great-souled ones delighting in the self have attained the great state.</p>
                <p>Having abandoned the unattained, being equal in what is attained,</p>
                <p>He who has no sorrow or joy in the unseen is called content.</p>
                <p>He who does not rejoice in the unattained, enjoys the attained as desired,</p>
                <p>With gentle conduct, is called content.</p>
                <p>He rejoices in the fortitude attained, like a virtuous woman in the inner court.</p>
                <p>That state of living liberation arises, giving the bliss of one’s nature.</p>
                <p>At the right time, according to scriptures, according to place, according to comfort,</p>
                <p>According to the possible association with the good, this path to liberation,</p>
                <p>The wise one should reflect upon until rest in the self.</p>
                <p>For one who has attained rest in the fourth state, withdrawn from the ocean of existence,</p>
                <p>Whether living or not living, whether a householder or an ascetic,</p>
                <p>There is no purpose in what is done or not done, nor in the confusion of scriptures and traditions.</p>
                <p>Like the ocean without a churner, he stays as he is.</p>
                <p>When the pure knowledge of all selves arises as your own,</p>
                <p>It shines beyond space, time, and directions, with the body of consciousness.</p>
                <p>Thus, when the self has attained manifestation wherever,</p>
                <p>It stays there quickly, and shines in that form.</p>
                <p>Whatever is seen, the entire world, moving and unmoving,</p>
                <p>Perishes at the end of the age like a dream in deep sleep.</p>
                <p>'Truth, self, supreme Brahman, reality,' etc., are imagined by the wise</p>
                <p>For the sake of transaction, as names of that great-souled one.</p>
                <p>Just as the meaning of 'bracelet' is not separate from gold,</p>
                <p>Nor from the golden bracelet, so is the meaning of 'world' supreme.</p>
                <p>Therefore, this magic of Indra is spread in the world.</p>
                <p>The inner existence of the seer and the seen is called bondage.</p>
                <p>The seer is bound by the seen; in the absence of the seen, he is liberated.</p>
                <p>The creation like 'I,' 'you,' 'world,' etc., is called the seen.</p>
                <p>Through the mind alone, the magic of Indra is spread in the world.</p>
                <p>As long as this exists, liberation does not exist.</p>
                <p>The world is created by Brahman through the mind alone.</p>
                <p>Therefore, the world that is seen is made of mind.</p>
                <p>The mind does not exist externally nor in the heart in the form of existence.</p>
                <p>That which is the appearance for the sake of meaning is called mind.</p>
                <p>Know that imagination is the mind; imagination does not exist.</p>
                <p>Where there is imagination, there the mind is understood to be.</p>
                <p>When imagination and mind are destroyed, never by anyone,</p>
                <p>When imagination is born and dissolved, the self-nature remains.</p>
                <p>When 'I,' 'you,' 'world,' etc., are calmed, the confusion of the seen,</p>
                <p>Then such aloneness may be; when the seen attains existence,</p>
                <p>At the time of the great dissolution, when complete non-existence is attained,</p>
                <p>When all seen is completely dissolved, at the beginning of creation, only peace remains.</p>
                <p>There is an unsetting, luminous, unborn, divine, free from disease,</p>
                <p>Always, all-doing, all, called the supreme self.</p>
                <p>From which words turn back, which is attained by the liberated,</p>
                <p>Whose names like self, etc., are imagined, not by nature.</p>
                <p>The mental space, the conscious space, and the third space,</p>
                <p>Know the conscious space as emptier than the two, O great sage.</p>
                <p>When the mind goes from one place to another, that which is in between,</p>
                <p>In an instant, know that as the conscious space, O best of sages.</p>
                <p>If you enter that state where all resolves are abandoned,</p>
                <p>You will certainly attain the peaceful state that is all-pervading.</p>
                <p>That which is born of generosity, beauty, detachment, and the essence of joy,</p>
                <p>Flowing with bliss, is called concentration.</p>
                <p>Through the understanding that the seen does not exist, in the attenuation of attachment and aversion,</p>
                <p>The delight that arises with strength is called concentration.</p>
                <p>The understanding that the seen does not exist is knowledge; the knowable is of the nature of consciousness.</p>
                <p>That alone is the state of aloneness; everything else is false.</p>
                <p>An elephant is bound in the corner of a mustard seed,</p>
                <p>A battle is fought by a mosquito with a multitude of lions in a dust particle.</p>
                <p>A lotus-eyed one places Mount Meru, swallowed by a bee’s son.</p>
                <p>Know, O Nidagha, that such is this world, made of delusion.</p>
                <p>The mind alone is the world, tainted by diseases and afflictions.</p>
                <p>When it is free from them, it is called the end of existence.</p>
                <p>Through the mind, the body attains embodiment.</p>
                <p>Freed from the desire for the body, one is not tainted by bodily qualities.</p>
                <p>It makes an age into a moment, a moment into an age.</p>
                <p>The play of the mind is the world; this is my certain opinion.</p>
                <p>Without abandoning bad conduct, without peace, without concentration,</p>
                <p>Or with an unpeaceful mind, one does not attain it through knowledge.</p>
                <p>That Brahman, bliss, without duality, without qualities, dense with truth and consciousness,</p>
                <p>Having known the form of one’s self, one never fears.</p>
                <p>That which is greater than the great, the great one,</p>
                <p>Eternal, auspicious, made of the light of its own nature,</p>
                <p>The ancient seer, the eternal Purusha,</p>
                <p>The lord of all, worshipped by all gods.</p>
                <p>'I am Brahman' is certainly the cause of liberation for the great-souled.</p>
                <p>There are two words for bondage and liberation: 'mine' and 'not mine.'</p>
                <p>By 'mine,' a being is bound; by 'not mine,' he is liberated.</p>
                <p>In the form of the individual and the lord, as conscious and inert,</p>
                <p>The creation from seeing to entering is imagined by the lord.</p>
                <p>The world from waking to liberation is imagined by the individual.</p>
                <p>From Triṇācika to Yoga, relying on the delusion of the lord,</p>
                <p>From Lokāyata to Sāṃkhya, relying on the delusion of the individual.</p>
                <p>Therefore, for those desiring liberation, the mind should not be on the individual or the lord,</p>
                <p>But the truth of Brahman should be reflected upon with a steady mind.</p>
                <p>He who sees everything without distinction due to the connection with consciousness,</p>
                <p>He alone is directly the knower, he is Shiva, he is Hari, he is Brahma.</p>
                <p>Difficult is the abandonment of objects, difficult is the vision of truth,</p>
                <p>Difficult is the natural state without the grace of the good guru.</p>
                <p>For the yogi whose power of knowledge has arisen, whose all actions are destroyed,</p>
                <p>The natural state arises by itself.</p>
                <p>When indeed this man knows even a little difference in this,</p>
                <p>Then he has fear; there is no doubt about it.</p>
                <p>He sees with the eye of knowledge the all-pervading existence, consciousness, and bliss.</p>
                <p>The eye of ignorance does not see, like the sun for the blind.</p>
                <p>Knowledge alone is that Brahman, characterized by truth and knowledge.</p>
                <p>Thus, through the complete knowledge of Brahman, a mortal becomes immortal.</p>
                <p>The knot of the heart is broken, all doubts are cut,</p>
                <p>And his actions are destroyed when that supreme and inferior is seen.</p>
                <p>Abandoning the non-self, in the unchanging state of the world,</p>
                <p>With single-mindedness, being inward, be devoted to pure consciousness.</p>
                <p>In the ocean of the world, all water is the desert itself.</p>
                <p>This triple world is all pure consciousness through self-reflection.</p>
                <p>Having abandoned the mind that is attached and unattached,</p>
                <p>He who stays as the self alone, he is indeed Shiva, the best of knowers of Brahman.</p>
                <p>The incomparable basis, beyond speech and mind,</p>
                <p>Eternal, all-pervading, omnipresent, extremely subtle, imperishable.</p>
                <p>The play of the great lord of all powers is the mind and the world.</p>
                <p>Through control and lack of control, the world attains peace.</p>
                <p>I shall tell you the remedy for the disease of the mind.</p>
                <p>By abandoning whatever is desired, one attains liberation.</p>
                <p>The art of creation, which is established, is called attachment.</p>
                <p>From the practice of the five stages, firmly delighting in the self,</p>
                <p>From the non-contemplation of internal and external objects.</p>
                <p>The sixth stage is the contemplation of objects,</p>
                <p>Which is the understanding through the effort of others for a long time.</p>
                <p>From the long practice of the six stages, from the non-perception of difference,</p>
                <p>The state of being established in one’s own nature is to be known as the fourth state.</p>
                <p>This indeed exists in the living liberated as the fourth state.</p>
                <p>Beyond that is the disembodied liberation.</p>
                <p>Those great ones, O Nidagha, who have attained the seventh stage,</p>
                <p>Delighting in the self, the great-souled ones have attained the great state.</p>
                <p>The living liberated do not immerse in the states of pleasure and pain.</p>
                <p>Whether they do or do not do anything according to nature or duty.</p>
                <p>Awakened by those nearby, following the previous conduct,</p>
                <p>They perform actions like one awakened from sleep.</p>
                <p>This sevenfold stage is within the scope of the wise.</p>
                <p>Having attained this state of knowledge, even beasts and barbarians,</p>
                <p>Whether with body or without body, they are liberated; there is no doubt.</p>
                <p>Knowledge is indeed the cutting of the knot; when it is present, there is liberation.</p>
                <p>Like the understanding of water in a mirage, it is merely calming.</p>
                <p>Those who have crossed the ocean of delusion have attained the supreme state.</p>
                <p>They, established in these stages, devoted to attaining the self,</p>
                <p>The means of calming the mind is called yoga.</p>
                <p>The seven stages are to be known; those stages have been described.</p>
                <p>The goal of these stages is the state called Brahman.</p>
                <p>Where there is no sense of 'I' or 'you,' no supreme state,</p>
                <p>No imagination anywhere, no existence or non-existence in perception.</p>
                <p>All is calm, without support, established in space, eternal, auspicious,</p>
                <p>Free from disease, without appearance, without name, without cause.</p>
                <p>Neither being nor non-being, neither middle nor end, neither all nor everything,</p>
                <p>Ungraspable by mind and speech, fuller than the full, happier than happiness.</p>
                <p>The non-perception that is completely calm, the perception of the self spread out.</p>
                <p>The existence of all objects is nothing but perception.</p>
                <p>In the relationship of the seer and the seen, the vision in between,</p>
                <p>Free from seer, seeing, and seen, that is this state.</p>
                <p>When the mind goes from one place to another, the consciousness in between,</p>
                <p>The non-inert perception, be always absorbed in that.</p>
                <p>That which is your eternal form, without waking, dream, or sleep,</p>
                <p>Neither inert nor non-inert, be always absorbed in that.</p>
                <p>Having abandoned the inertness, the heart is like a stone,</p>
                <p>Whose nature is without mind, be always absorbed in that.</p>
                <p>Having completely abandoned the mind, be steady as you are.</p>
                <p>The mind arose from the supreme self-truth,</p>
                <p>By it, this world is spread with the net of imaginations.</p>
                <p>Like the sky, which is empty, yet appears blue,</p>
                <p>O sage, it shines beautifully with the name of blue.</p>
                <p>When the mind is dissolved through the destruction of resolves,</p>
                <p>The mists of delusion in the world dissolve.</p>
                <p>Like the sky in autumn, it shines clearly,</p>
                <p>Pure consciousness alone, unborn, primeval, infinite within.</p>
                <p>Like a picture arising in the sky without a doer or color,</p>
                <p>The experience of the self without seeing, like a dream without sleep.</p>
                <p>In the witness, equal, pure, without imaginations, in the self of consciousness,</p>
                <p>The worlds reflect desirelessly, like in a mirror.</p>
                <p>One Brahman, the space of consciousness, all-pervading, undivided.</p>
                <p>Contemplate this with effort for the calming of the mind’s restlessness.</p>
                <p>Like a stone with lines upon lines,</p>
                <p>So see the one Brahman enveloped by the three worlds.</p>
                <p>Due to the absence of a second cause, this world is uncreated.</p>
                <p>Known, to be known now, seen, to be seen, wonderful.</p>
                <p>I am rested, long tired; there is nothing but pure consciousness.</p>
                <p>See, with doubts rested, with all curiosity gone.</p>
                <p>The supreme state is without the net of imaginations, without mind.</p>
                <p>Those alone have attained the state, with all sins calmed.</p>
                <p>The great-minded, with peaceful intellects, who have attained mindlessness.</p>
                <p>For a being who has reflected, whose mind’s functions have fallen,</p>
                <p>Who always abandons contemplation, abandoning the rejectable, attaining the acceptable.</p>
                <p>Seeing the seer always, not seeing the non-seer,</p>
                <p>In the supreme truth to be known, being awake while living.</p>
                <p>For one asleep in the path of the world, which is a delusion of wealth,</p>
                <p>From extreme ripened detachment, even in tastes without taste.</p>
                <p>When the net of world-desires is broken like a bird’s net,</p>
                <p>When the knot of the heart is loosened by the speed of detachment.</p>
                <p>As water becomes clear by obtaining the clearing nut,</p>
                <p>So the nature becomes clear through knowledge.</p>
                <p>Free from attachment, without association, without duality, without support,</p>
                <p>The mind goes out from delusion like a bird from a cage.</p>
                <p>With doubts and wickedness calmed, with curiosity and confusion gone,</p>
                <p>The mind, full within, shines like the full moon.</p>
                <p>There is neither I nor anything else here; I am Brahman, free from disease.</p>
                <p>Thus, from the middle of existence and non-existence, he who sees, sees.</p>
                <p>As the mind falls without attachment on objects seen by the eyes,</p>
                <p>So does the intellect of the wise fall on actions.</p>
                <p>When enjoyment is fully known and experienced, it becomes satisfaction.</p>
                <p>When a thief is known and served, he becomes a friend, not a thief.</p>
                <p>Like travelers who unexpectedly come upon a village festival,</p>
                <p>So do the wise see the splendor of enjoyment.</p>
                <p>The playful enjoyment of the controlled mind, even if small,</p>
                <p>Is considered great due to its difficulty, without expansion.</p>
                <p>A king, bound and liberated, is satisfied with a mere morsel.</p>
                <p>Unbound by others, unconquered, he does not consider the kingdom much.</p>
                <p>Pressing hand with hand, grinding teeth with teeth,</p>
                <p>Attacking limbs with limbs, first conquer your own mind.</p>
                <p>From the conquest of the mind, there is no other way in the ocean of existence.</p>
                <p>In the great hell of the empire, the intoxicated elephants of misdeeds,</p>
                <p>Full of arrows of desires, the enemies of the senses are hard to conquer.</p>
                <p>For one whose pride of mind is destroyed, whose enemies of the senses are controlled,</p>
                <p>The desires for enjoyment diminish like lotuses in winter.</p>
                <p>As long as the mind is not conquered through firm practice of the one truth,</p>
                <p>The desires dwell in the heart like demons at night.</p>
                <p>The servant due to doing what is desired, the minister due to causing all purposes,</p>
                <p>The vassal due to conquering the senses—I consider the mind of the discriminating.</p>
                <p>From nurturing, the affectionate beloved; from protecting, the protective father;</p>
                <p>From excellent arrangement, the friend—I consider the mind of the wise.</p>
                <p>From its own light, from the vision of scriptures, from one’s own intellect, from one’s experience,</p>
                <p>It gives supreme accomplishment; abandoning oneself, the mind is the father.</p>
                <p>Very joyful, very firm, very pure, very accomplished, very awakened,</p>
                <p>With its own quality, it shines in the heart, the charming jewel of the mind.</p>
                <p>This jewel of the mind, O Brahman, stained with much mud,</p>
                <p>Wash it with the water of discrimination for success and become enlightened.</p>
                <p>Relying on supreme discrimination, seeing the truth with intellect,</p>
                <p>Cutting the enemies of the senses, cross the ocean of existence.</p>
                <p>They know that attachment alone is the mine of infinite sorrows.</p>
                <p>They know that non-attachment is the abode of happiness everywhere.</p>
                <p>This world, bound by the threads of desires, revolves.</p>
                <p>It is for evident great sorrow; for happiness, it comes to destruction.</p>
                <p>Even the wise, very learned, of good family, great,</p>
                <p>Are bound by desire like a lion by a chain.</p>
                <p>Having taken up supreme effort and diligence according to scriptures,</p>
                <p>Without agitation, who does not attain success?</p>
                <p>I am all this world, I am the imperishable supreme self.</p>
                <p>There is nothing else—by this understanding, that is the supreme ego.</p>
                <p>I am distinct from all, thinner than the tip of a hair.</p>
                <p>This is the second auspicious ego, O Brahman.</p>
                <p>This is for liberation, not for bondage, for the living liberated.</p>
                <p>This body is merely hands, feet, etc.—this is the third certainty,</p>
                <p>The worldly ego, which is indeed trivial.</p>
                <p>The individual alone is the evil one, the root of the difficult tree of the world.</p>
                <p>Struck by this, a being runs lower and lower.</p>
                <p>By abandoning this evil ego for a long time,</p>
                <p>A being with the remaining ego, peaceful, attains liberation.</p>
                <p>Having accepted the first two extraordinary egos,</p>
                <p>The third worldly ego, which gives sorrow, should be abandoned.</p>
                <p>Then, having abandoned all egos,</p>
                <p>He stays very high, ascending to the supreme.</p>
                <p>Bondage is merely the desire for enjoyment; its abandonment is called liberation.</p>
                <p>The rise of the mind is destruction; the destruction of the mind is great rise.</p>
                <p>The mind of the knower attains destruction; the mind is the chain of the ignorant.</p>
                <p>Neither joyful nor joyless, neither moving nor still,</p>
                <p>Neither being nor non-being, nor their middle—thus know the mind of the knower.</p>
                <p>As due to subtlety, the reflection of consciousness in space is not perceived,</p>
                <p>So the partless consciousness, though all-pervading, is not perceived.</p>
                <p>Devoid of all resolves, devoid of all names,</p>
                <p>That consciousness, indestructible, is called the self, etc.</p>
                <p>Among the knowers, it is partless, seeing the one self in the pure and impure world.</p>
                <p>It neither sets nor rises, neither stands nor stays,</p>
                <p>Neither goes nor comes, neither here nor there.</p>
                <p>That consciousness is formless, without imaginations, without support.</p>
                <p>First, purify the disciple with qualities like calmness and self-control.</p>
                <p>Afterwards, teach that all this is Brahman, and you are pure.</p>
                <p>He who says to the ignorant or half-awakened, 'All is Brahman,'</p>
                <p>Is placed in the nets of great hells.</p>
                <p>For one whose intellect is awakened, whose desire for enjoyment is destroyed, who is desireless,</p>
                <p>There is no dirt of ignorance—thus should the wise guru instruct.</p>
                <p>Like light when there is a lamp, like day when there is the sun,</p>
                <p>Like fragrance when there is a flower, so is the world when there is consciousness.</p>
                <p>This appears only as an appearance, not in reality.</p>
                <p>When the vision of knowledge is clear, when the rise of awakening is spread,</p>
                <p>You will know properly, O healthy one, the strength of my words.</p>
                <p>Through ignorance alone, with the supreme effort for one’s own destruction,</p>
                <p>Knowledge is attained, O Brahman, which removes all faults.</p>
                <p>A weapon is calmed by a weapon, dirt is washed by dirt.</p>
                <p>Poison goes by poison, an enemy is killed by an enemy.</p>
                <p>Such is this elemental illusion, which gives joy through its own destruction.</p>
                <p>Its nature is not perceived; when observed, it vanishes.</p>
                <p>'It does not exist in reality'—thus one should contemplate with intellect.</p>
                <p>That contemplation 'All is Brahman' indeed gives liberation.</p>
                <p>The vision of difference is ignorance; abandon it completely.</p>
                <p>O sage, that imperishable state is not attained.</p>
                <p>Do not have the thought, 'From where did this arise?'</p>
                <p>Have the thought, 'How shall I destroy this?'</p>
                <p>When it is gone and destroyed, you will know that state.</p>
                <p>Do effort in treating this disease,</p>
                <p>So that it does not place you again in the sorrows of birth.</p>
                <p>In your own self, with its own vibrations, the ocean of consciousness shines.</p>
                <p>Contemplate firmly that it is one, undivided.</p>
                <p>That power of consciousness, slightly agitated in form,</p>
                <p>Shines purely in the ocean of consciousness, like a wave in the ocean.</p>
                <p>In the self, by the self, in space, like the wind in a lake,</p>
                <p>Thus, the self, by its own power, attains movement in itself.</p>
                <p>For a moment, that goddess shines with all powers.</p>
                <p>Space, time, action, power do not limit her.</p>
                <p>Having known her own nature, even though established in the infinite state,</p>
                <p>She contemplates a limited form, though uncontemplated.</p>
                <p>When such a form is contemplated by that supremely beloved,</p>
                <p>Then, following her, the views of name, number, etc., arise.</p>
                <p>This form of consciousness, imagined with imaginations, the abode of space, time, and action,</p>
                <p>O Brahman, is called the knower of the field.</p>
                <p>He, imagining desires, again attains egohood.</p>
                <p>The ego, the determiner, tainted, is called intellect.</p>
                <p>The intellect, with imagined forms, attains the state of mind.</p>
                <p>The mind, with dense imaginations, slowly attains the state of senses.</p>
                <p>The senses are known by the wise as the body made of hands and feet.</p>
                <p>Thus, the individual, bound by the rope of imaginative desires,</p>
                <p>Surrounded by the net of sorrows, gradually attains lowliness.</p>
                <p>Thus, the mind, made of power, having attained dense egohood,</p>
                <p>Like a silkworm, willingly goes into bondage.</p>
                <p>Having itself imagined the net of subtle elements within,</p>
                <p>It attains great helplessness, like a lion bound by chains.</p>
                <p>Sometimes mind, sometimes intellect, sometimes knowledge, sometimes action,</p>
                <p>Sometimes this ego, sometimes called mind.</p>
                <p>Sometimes called nature, sometimes imagined as illusion,</p>
                <p>Sometimes called dirt, sometimes remembered as action.</p>
                <p>Sometimes known as bondage, sometimes remembered as the city of eight,</p>
                <p>Called ignorance sometimes, accepted as desire sometimes.</p>
                <p>This entire world, indicating the noose of desires,</p>
                <p>Bears within, like a fig tree bearing figs, without fruits.</p>
                <p>Burnt by the flame of thought, chewed by the serpent of anger,</p>
                <p>Delighting in the waves of the ocean of desire, having forgotten the grandfather self,</p>
                <p>Lift up the mind, O Brahman, like an elephant from mud.</p>
                <p>Thus, the states dependent on the individual, caused by the contemplation of existence,</p>
                <p>Imagined by Brahman in forms, in lakhs or crores,</p>
                <p>Countless, born before, are born even now everywhere,</p>
                <p>And will be born again, like streams of particles from a waterfall.</p>
                <p>Some with first birth, some with more than a hundred births,</p>
                <p>Some with countless births, some with two or three existences,</p>
                <p>Some as Kinnaras, Gandharvas, Vidyadharas, great serpents,</p>
                <p>Some as sun, moon, Varuna, three-eyed, lord of senses, Brahma,</p>
                <p>Some as Brahmanas, kings, Vaishyas, Shudras,</p>
                <p>Some as grass, herbs, trees, fruits, roots, insects,</p>
                <p>Some as Kadamba, Jambira, Sala, Tala, Tamala trees,</p>
                <p>Some as Mount Mahendra, Malaya, Sahya, Mandara, Meru,</p>
                <p>Some as oceans of salt, milk, ghee, sugarcane juice,</p>
                <p>Some as vast directions, some as rivers with great speed,</p>
                <p>Some fly high in the sky, fall and rise again,</p>
                <p>Like balls hit by death incessantly.</p>
                <p>Having experienced thousands of births, again in the difficulty of the world,</p>
                <p>Some ignorant ones fall, even after attaining discrimination.</p>
                <p>The self-truth, unlimited by space, time, etc., through its own power,</p>
                <p>Playfully assumes a body limited by space and time.</p>
                <p>That itself, through the influence of individual desires, becomes the mind,</p>
                <p>Unsteady, inclined to imagination and non-imagination.</p>
                <p>The power of the mind first contemplates in a moment</p>
                <p>The contemplation of space, pure, inclined to the taste of sound-seed.</p>
                <p>Then, having attained density, through the sequence of dense movement, the mind</p>
                <p>Contemplates the movement of wind, inclined to the taste of touch-seed.</p>
                <p>From space and wind, through the force of firm practice,</p>
                <p>From the forms of sound and touch, through friction, fire is born.</p>
                <p>With the subtle element of form, measured with those three,</p>
                <p>The mind attains that quality, the perception of taste-subtle element.</p>
                <p>In a moment, it perceives the coolness of water, then the knowledge of water.</p>
                <p>Then, attaining that quality, the mind contemplates in a moment</p>
                <p>The subtle element of smell; from that, the knowledge of earth arises.</p>
                <p>Then, enveloped by the subtle elements thus, abandoning subtlety,</p>
                <p>It sees the body shining in space like a spark of fire,</p>
                <p>Endowed with the imagination of ego, accompanied by the seed of intellect.</p>
                <p>That is called the city of eight, the six-footed one in the heart-lotus of beings.</p>
                <p>In that, through intense impulse, contemplating the luminous body,</p>
                <p>It attains grossness through cooking, like the fruit of the Bilva tree.</p>
                <p>Like melted gold in a crucible, shining in the pure sky,</p>
                <p>Then, that light assumes a form by its own nature:</p>
                <p>Above, the head-mass; below, the feet;</p>
                <p>On the sides, the hands; in the middle, the belly.</p>
                <p>In time, attaining clarity, it becomes a spotless body,</p>
                <p>Established in intellect, goodness, strength, enthusiasm, knowledge, sovereignty.</p>
                <p>He is the blessed Brahma, the grandfather of all worlds.</p>
                <p>Seeing his own excellent, beautiful body, Brahma,</p>
                <p>Attaining thought, the seer of the three times without impurity,</p>
                <p>Thought, 'In this supreme space, consisting of pure consciousness alone,</p>
                <p>Unseen, with unlimited ends, what was first?'</p>
                <p>Thus, Brahma thought, and immediately, with a pure self-vision,</p>
                <p>Saw the multitudes of creations that had passed before.</p>
                <p>Then, he remembered all, with all qualities and sequences.</p>
                <p>Playfully, he created various creatures from imagination,</p>
                <p>With various conducts and beginnings, like a Gandharva city.</p>
                <p>For their sake, for heaven and liberation, for the attainment of duty, desire, and wealth,</p>
                <p>He created countless wonderful scriptures.</p>
                <p>From the form of Brahma, since the world is created from the mind,</p>
                <p>Its existence is said to last as long as that; with its destruction, it attains destruction.</p>
                <p>Nothing is born, nothing dies, anywhere, ever.</p>
                <p>In reality, O best of Brahmins, all is seen falsely.</p>
                <p>Abandon the spectacle of the world, the snakes of desires in the sheath.</p>
                <p>Knowing that this is unreal, establish the state of the mother.</p>
                <p>For the decorated or undecorated Gandharva city,</p>
                <p>In the part of ignorance, in son, etc., what is the order of happiness and sorrow?</p>
                <p>In increased wealth and wives, there is no satisfaction in sorrow.</p>
                <p>When the illusion of delusion increases, who is comforted here?</p>
                <p>By whom attachment arises in the fool, by those very parts,</p>
                <p>In the wise, detachment arises.</p>
                <p>Therefore, O Nidagha, knower of truth, in the transactions of the world,</p>
                <p>Neglect what is lost as lost, accept what is gained as gained.</p>
                <p>The natural non-desire for future enjoyments,</p>
                <p>And the enjoyment of what comes—these are the marks of the learned.</p>
                <p>Having understood the state between existence and non-existence, relying on it,</p>
                <p>Do not grasp the seen, external and internal; do not abandon it.</p>
                <p>For the knower who acts with desire and without desire,</p>
                <p>His wisdom is not tainted, like a lotus leaf by water.</p>
                <p>If the splendor of sense objects does not stir in your heart, O twice-born,</p>
                <p>Then you have known what is to be known, crossed the ocean of existence.</p>
                <p>With supreme wisdom, from the multitude of desires,</p>
                <p>Like extracting fragrance from a flower, separate the mind’s function.</p>
                <p>In this ocean of the world, flooded with the water of desires,</p>
                <p>Those who have boarded the ship of wisdom have crossed, the supreme learned ones.</p>
                <p>They neither abandon nor desire the transactions of the world.</p>
                <p>They follow everything, the knowers of the ocean.</p>
                <p>Of the infinite self-truth, in the form of general existence,</p>
                <p>The inclination of consciousness towards objects is known as the sprout of resolve.</p>
                <p>Having attained a little existence, it slowly attains density,</p>
                <p>Becomes mind, filling with inertia like a cloud.</p>
                <p>Consciousness contemplates objects as if separate from itself,</p>
                <p>Like a seed becoming a sprout.</p>
                <p>Imagination itself gives birth to imagination.</p>
                <p>It grows quickly by itself, for sorrow, not for happiness.</p>
                <p>Do not imagine imagination; do not contemplate states in stability.</p>
                <p>Being effortful in destroying imagination, it does not follow again.</p>
                <p>By mere non-contemplation, imagination perishes by itself.</p>
                <p>With imagination alone, cut the imagination; with the mind, the mind, O sage.</p>
                <p>Having cut it, stay in the self; what is difficult in this?</p>
                <p>Just as this space is empty, so is the world empty.</p>
                <p>As the skin of rice, as the blackness of copper,</p>
                <p>Perishes through action, so does the dirt of a person.</p>
                <p>Like the dirt of the individual’s rice, though natural,</p>
                <p>It certainly perishes; there is no doubt; therefore, be diligent."</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Thus is the Mahopanishad.</p>

                <p>"Having abandoned the inner attachment to the splendor of states, which is made of contemplation,</p>
                <p>As you are, so you are; play in this world, O sinless one.</p>
                <p>With the firm contemplation 'I am not the doer everywhere,'</p>
                <p>That supreme nectar-named equanimity alone remains.</p>
                <p>In the plays of sorrow, joy, and delight, with the sole doership of the self,</p>
                <p>When one’s resolve perishes, equanimity alone remains.</p>
                <p>That equanimity in all states is the supreme true state.</p>

                <p>Or, O sage, having abandoned all doership and non-doership,</p>
                <p>Having drunk the mind, be steady as you are.</p>
                <p>Abandon that which you abandon for the sake of stability and concentration.</p>
                <p>The form of the mind’s imagination, light and darkness, etc.,</p>
                <p>Desire and its agent, along with the movement of breath,</p>
                <p>Having completely abandoned all with roots, be peaceful like space, with intellect calmed.</p>
                <p>Having completely abandoned all rows of desires from the heart,</p>
                <p>He who stays without anxiety is liberated, the supreme lord.</p>
                <p>The seen and the to-be-seen are all seen; the ten directions are deluded by delusion.</p>
                <p>For the knower who acts with reason, the world is like a cow’s footprint.</p>
                <p>In the body, external and internal, below, above, and in the directions,</p>
                <p>Here is the self, there is the self; there is no world made of non-self.</p>
                <p>There is nothing where I am not, there is nothing that is not mine.</p>
                <p>What else do I desire? All is pervaded by existence and consciousness.</p>
                <p>All this is indeed Brahman; all this is the self spread out.</p>
                <p>Abandon the delusion 'I am other, this is other,' O sinless one.</p>
                <p>In that dense Brahman, eternal, imagined things do not exist.</p>
                <p>There is no sorrow, no delusion, no old age, no birth.</p>
                <p>What exists here, that alone exists; be always free from fever.</p>
                <p>From experiencing what comes, from not desiring everywhere,</p>
                <p>From abandoning taking and giving, be always free from fever.</p>
                <p>He whose birth is final, O great-minded one,</p>
                <p>Quickly enters the pure knowledge like a bee into a bamboo.</p>
                <p>For those with detached minds, properly through their own association,</p>
                <p>It is said: From the union of the seer and the seen, there is certainty of the bliss of perception.</p>
                <p>We worship that self-arisen, motionless bliss.</p>
                <p>Having abandoned the seer, seeing, and seen along with desire,</p>
                <p>We worship the self, the appearance of the perception of seeing.</p>
                <p>Always in the middle of the two, 'exists' and 'does not exist,'</p>
                <p>We worship the self, the illuminator of lights.</p>
                <p>Those who, abandoning the lord in the cave of the heart, go to another god,</p>
                <p>Desire a jewel while abandoning the Kaustubha gem in their hand.</p>
                <p>Repeatedly, with the rod of discrimination,</p>
                <p>Kill the enemies of the senses, arisen or unarisen, like Indra killing mountains with his thunderbolt.</p>
                <p>In the dream of the night of the world, in the empty delusion of the body,</p>
                <p>All is indeed impure; the seen is the delusion of the world.</p>
                <p>Afflicted by ignorance in childhood, struck by women in youth,</p>
                <p>In the rest, afflicted by thoughts of family—what does the lowly man do?</p>
                <p>Non-existence stands on the head of existence, unpleasantness on the head of the pleasant,</p>
                <p>Sorrows on the head of happiness—what one thing shall I resort to?</p>
                <p>For those whose blinking causes the destruction and creation of the world,</p>
                <p>Such persons go; what is the counting of those like me?</p>
                <p>The world alone is said to be the limit of sorrows.</p>
                <p>How can happiness be attained by the body fallen in its midst?</p>
                <p>'I am awakened, I am awakened; this mind is a wicked thief.</p>
                <p>I shall kill it, for I have been stolen by the mind for a long time.'</p>
                <p>Do not grieve for the rejectable; do not be devoted to the acceptable.</p>
                <p>Having abandoned the views of rejectable and acceptable, be steady in what remains.</p>
                <p>Desirelessness, fearlessness, eternity, equanimity, knowledge,</p>
                <p>Desirelessness, inactivity, gentleness, freedom from imaginations,</p>
                <p>Firmness, friendliness, contentment of mind, softness, gentle speech—</p>
                <p>These dwell in the knower free from rejectable and acceptable, without desires.</p>
                <p>Having cut with the sharp blade of intellect the net of desires spread like a hunter’s net,</p>
                <p>The water of the world spread with the threads of thoughts,</p>
                <p>O dear one, having cut it like a cloud with a gale, stay in that state.</p>
                <p>Having cut the mind with the mind, like cutting a tree with an axe,</p>
                <p>Having attained the pure state, be steady immediately.</p>
                <p>Whether sitting, going, sleeping, waking, dwelling, flying, falling,</p>
                <p>Having determined that all this is unreal, abandon it completely.</p>
                <p>If you rely on the seen, then you are bound with consciousness.</p>
                <p>If you abandon the seen, then you are without mind, liberated.</p>
                <p>Meditating 'I am not, nor is this,' stay as the immovable mountain.</p>
                <p>Between the self and the world, between the seer and the seen,</p>
                <p>Be always contemplating the self called vision.</p>
                <p>Having abandoned the taste and the taster, being in the middle of taste and taster,</p>
                <p>Meditating on the mere tasting, become absorbed in the supreme self.</p>
                <p>Relying on the supportless, be steady in the middle of the middle.</p>
                <p>Those bound by a rope are liberated; those bound by desire are not liberated by anyone.</p>
                <p>Therefore, O Nidagha, abandon desire through the abandonment of resolves.</p>
                <p>Having cut this evil ego made of 'I'-ness with the blade of 'not-I'-ness,</p>
                <p>In the state of being and becoming, be with all fears of beings calmed.</p>
                <p>'I am of these objects, and these are my life.</p>
                <p>Without them, I am nothing, and without me, they are not.'</p>
                <p>Having abandoned this inner certainty, reflecting with the mind,</p>
                <p>When 'I am not of the object, nor is the object mine' is contemplated,</p>
                <p>With a cool inner intellect, performing actions playfully,</p>
                <p>That abandonment of desires is indeed proclaimed, O Brahman.</p>
                <p>Having made the destruction of desires with equanimity in all,</p>
                <p>He who abandons the body without attachment is not to be led; that is the destruction of desires.</p>
                <p>He who, having abandoned the desire born of ego,</p>
                <p>Stays playfully, abandoning the object of meditation, is called the living liberated.</p>
                <p>He who, having completely abandoned the root of imagination, desires,</p>
                <p>Has attained peace, know him as liberated, the best of Brahmins.</p>
                <p>These two have attained Brahman, these two are free from fever:</p>
                <p>The renunciant and the yogi, controlled, know them as peaceful, O lord of sages.</p>
                <p>He who has no praise or blame for desired or undesired things in his inner vision,</p>
                <p>And moves like one in deep sleep, is called the living liberated.</p>
                <p>He who neither rejoices nor grieves, free from reflections,</p>
                <p>With views of joy, anger, fear, wrath, desire, miserliness.</p>
                <p>The desire arising from external objects is called bound.</p>
                <p>The desire free from all objects is called liberated.</p>
                <p>The intense chain of desire, accompanied by prayer,</p>
                <p>Know it as giving birth to sorrow and fear.</p>
                <p>Abandoning that in all states, whether existing or not, always,</p>
                <p>The great-minded one attains the supremely generous state.</p>
                <p>Abandoning the states of bondage and liberation, of happiness and sorrow,</p>
                <p>Of existence and non-existence, stay like an undisturbed great ocean.</p>
                <p>O good one, four kinds of certainty arise in a person.</p>
                <p>From head to toe, I am created by mother and father—</p>
                <p>This is one certainty, O Brahman, for bondage, from seeing poison.</p>
                <p>I am thinner than the tip of a hair, beyond all states—</p>
                <p>This is the second certainty for liberation, arising in the good.</p>
                <p>I am the self of all objects in the world, imperishable—</p>
                <p>This third certainty is also said for liberation, O best of twice-born.</p>
                <p>I or the entire world is always empty, equal to space—</p>
                <p>This fourth certainty also gives the attainment of liberation.</p>
                <p>Among these, the first is said to be with desire suitable for bondage.</p>
                <p>The three pure desires are for the living liberated, playful.</p>
                <p>The certainty 'I am all this,' O great-minded one,</p>
                <p>Having taken it, the mind does not arise again for sorrow.</p>
                <p>It is called void, nature, illusion, Brahman, knowledge,</p>
                <p>Shiva, Purusha, Ishana, eternal, self.</p>
                <p>Through the play of creating the world born of duality and non-duality,</p>
                <p>The supreme self-power shines as non-duality alone.</p>
                <p>Relying on the state beyond all, completely filled with one consciousness,</p>
                <p>Without agitation, without a satisfied self, he does not sink in the world.</p>
                <p>Always performing attained actions, seeing enemies and friends equally,</p>
                <p>Free from desired and undesired, he neither grieves nor desires.</p>
                <p>Speaking what is agreeable to all, when urged, with beautiful speech,</p>
                <p>Knowing the intentions of beings, he does not sink in the world.</p>
                <p>Having taken up the previous vision, delighting in the abandonment of the object of meditation,</p>
                <p>Established in living liberation, play in the world free from fever.</p>
                <p>Having completely abandoned all desires within, free from attachment, without desires,</p>
                <p>With all external conduct, play in the world free from fever.</p>
                <p>With artificial enthusiasm externally, without enthusiasm in the heart,</p>
                <p>A doer externally, a non-doer internally, play in the world with pure intellect.</p>
                <p>Having abandoned ego, at peace, with a mind like space,</p>
                <p>Without the mark of impurity, play in the world with pure intellect.</p>
                <p>Generous, with gentle conduct, following all conducts,</p>
                <p>Internally abandoning attachment, externally as if with possessions,</p>
                <p>Internally with detachment, externally as if desiring.</p>
                <p>'This is a friend, this is not'—such calculation is for the small-minded.</p>
                <p>For those with generous conduct, the whole earth is family.</p>
                <p>Free from existence and non-existence, free from old age and death,</p>
                <p>Rely on the state that is calm, without imaginations, without attachment.</p>
                <p>This is the state of Brahman, pure, without desires, free from disease.</p>
                <p>Having taken it, one who plays thus does not become deluded in difficulties.</p>
                <p>Through detachment, through scriptures, through qualities like greatness,</p>
                <p>For the sake of destroying resolves, one should oneself elevate the mind.</p>
                <p>Through detachment, the mind attains fullness, following destruction.</p>
                <p>It attains redness through desire, like a lake in autumn.</p>
                <p>Again and again, performing the multitude of actions without taste for enjoyment,</p>
                <p>O wise one, why are you not ashamed day after day?</p>
                <p>Consciousness tainted by objects is bondage; in its liberation, liberation is said.</p>
                <p>Consciousness without objects is indeed the self—this is the summary of all doctrines.</p>
                <p>Having taken this certainty, see with intellect and wisdom.</p>
                <p>You yourself will attain the blissful state of the self through the self.</p>
                <p>I am consciousness, these worlds are consciousness, the directions are consciousness, these beings are consciousness.</p>
                <p>Free from the seen and seeing, I am alone, pure in form.</p>
                <p>Eternally arisen, without appearance, the seer, the witness, of the nature of consciousness.</p>
                <p>The form of consciousness free from objects, the form of full light,</p>
                <p>With all knowables calmed, I am great, mere consciousness.</p>
                <p>With all resolves calmed, with all desires calmed,</p>
                <p>Having gone to the state without imaginations, be established, O lord of sages."</p>

            <p>Thus.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>He who studies this Mahopanishad daily, a Brahmin,</p>
                <p>Becomes a scholar if not a scholar, becomes initiated if not initiated.</p>
                <p>He becomes purified by fire, purified by wind, purified by the moon,</p>
                <p>Purified by truth, purified by all. He becomes known by all gods.</p>
                <p>He becomes bathed in all sacred places. He becomes meditated upon by all gods.</p>
                <p>He becomes one who has sacrificed with all rituals. The fruits of chanting sixty thousand Gayatris are attained.</p>
                <p>The fruits of chanting a hundred thousand Itihasas and Puranas are attained.</p>
                <p>Ten thousand Pranavas are chanted. He purifies the row up to the eyes.</p>
                <p>He purifies up to the seventh generation. Thus says the blessed Hiranyagarbha.</p>
                <p>By chanting this, one attains immortality—thus is the Upanishad.</p>
